Pokémon Simulator

NOTE: All current development is on the "complete_api_overhaul" branch; the structure of the repository is in the middle of changing. This API is stable on GCC, Clang, and MSVC, but it will no longer be updated. The "complete_api_overhaul" branch has no guarantee of compilability, but it will eventually be merged into master once it is stable.
