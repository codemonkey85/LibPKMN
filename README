Pokemon Sim

Data structures written to construct a Pokemon team, complete with movesets.
This allows for apps to be written to find type weaknesses in teams, calculate
damage ranges for different scenarios, and many other in-game situations.

Pokemon info, algorithms, etc., all taken from:
Bulbapedia (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page)

Tested with GCC 4.6.3 and MSVC 2012.
