Get Type Stats
*
* Takes a type or type combination, as well as a generation,
* as inputs and outputs the names of the Pokemon with the
* highest and lowest values for each base stat (HP, Attack, etc).
*
* Inputs:
*  - gen (1-5): Confines search to Pokemon present in specified
*               generation
*
*  - type1:     Specify first type to use in search
*
*  - type2:     Specify a second type to use in search
*
*  - lax:       If only one type is specified, allow
*               for any type combination with specified
*               type. If not specified, will only show Pokemon
*               with that single type
*
*  - evolved:   will only show fully evolved Pokemon
*

*              one per line. Will fail if Pokemon name is
